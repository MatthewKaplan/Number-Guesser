# Number-Guesser
Create a number guesser game where the user guesses a number between 1-100
Thisrules of the game are pretty simple: 
1. You and a second player have the option of setting a number between 1-100(or as high and low as you want it really). 
2. After you set the range or stay with the default 1-100, you and the second player will enter your name, and guess, and hit the submit button. 
3. After hitting the submit button at the bottom of the left side of the screen, it will display yours and your partners guesses, and text to say if your guess was too high, too low, or BOOM, right on the money. 
4. After one of you guess the correct number a window will appear on the right side of the screen with the two challengers vs each other names, and the winners name displayed in large text. Under the winner name it will display a count of how many guesses it took, and how long it took you.
5. After each consecutive win the game will automatically increase your upper and lower limit by 10.

I hope all of you enjoy playing and please let us know how we can improve!
